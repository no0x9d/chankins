## What is Chankins?
Chankins manages your code changes and builds release notes for your multi module project.
It holds a your changes based on a release with additional metadata and can generate release notes from a supplied template.

## When not to use Chankins?
If you have all changes in a issue tracker like github or a jira project and you just want release notes, there are better integrated solutions.
Also if your project just has one module or is shipping at once Chankins might be a bit to much, but still usable.

## Getting started
